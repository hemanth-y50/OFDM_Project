# OFDM_Project
- OFDM simulations and documentation for wireless communication systems ‚Äî includes Python, MATLAB, C, and C++ implementations.
# OFDM Simulation Lab ‚Äì Day 1

This repository contains annotated simulations and visualizations for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM), a core modulation technique used in modern wireless communication systems such as LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

## üìò Overview

Day 1 focuses on building a minimal OFDM system using Python and visualizing its behavior under an AWGN channel. The simulation includes:
- QAM symbol mapping
- IFFT-based OFDM modulation
- Cyclic Prefix addition
- AWGN channel modeling
- FFT-based demodulation
- Symbol error analysis
- Six key plots saved for documentation

## üß† Concepts Covered

- Orthogonality of subcarriers
- FFT/IFFT modulation and demodulation
- Cyclic Prefix and ISI mitigation
- 16-QAM modulation
- AWGN channel effects
- Symbol error visualization

## üìä Plots Included

All plots are saved in the `plots/` folder:
- `constellation.png`: Transmitted vs received symbols
- `time_domain_before_cp.png`: OFDM symbol before CP
- `time_domain_with_cp.png`: OFDM signal with CP
- `spectrum.png`: Frequency-domain subcarrier spectrum
- `noise.png`: AWGN noise visualization
- `error_magnitude.png`: Symbol error per subcarrier
